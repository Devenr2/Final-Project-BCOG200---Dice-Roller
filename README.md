# Final-Project-BCOG200---Dice-Roller
Project Pitch:
This project is for a Dice Rolling program that is intended for use with Dungeons and Dragons character. The program will ideally work in two-three parts: character stats and Dice rolling.
You will input your character's raw stat numbers in the first part, and then roll the dice in the second part, while accounting for the specific stat, die type, and advantage or disadvantage. 
I am leaving room for increased capabilities for things such as random character generation, and proficiency rolls

Functions
  1. A function that allows for the user to input their characters name, class, level and raw stat numbers. Alternitavly, I could make a funcition for "random" character generation
  2. A function that allows the user to select the type of dice they wish to roll, what stat it is rolled on, if they have proficieny, and if it has advantage/disadvantage.
  3. A function that actually rolls the die and then outputs the number to the player, with special messages for natural 20's and natural 1's (probably use Numpy for random rolling, and something else for visual component)
