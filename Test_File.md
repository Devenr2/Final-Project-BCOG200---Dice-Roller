#This is where I will put the test parameters. I will need to also come up with some test values for Player Stats which will be an input

A person can test the program as a whole by putting in the Test Character Stats found below. 
They could then run any of the dice rolls they wish to test. 
This would include testing the d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d100 and a many d20 rolls.

If you wanted to test for EVERY possible outcome, it would require rolling the d20 over 1000 times. Yes, I do plan to do this to actually test my program, but I do not reccomend for other people to do so.
As this program allows for user choice in what dice is rolled, there will natrually be no One Way to test ALL possible outcomes simultaneously.
