#This file is going to contain the code for my project. I need to outline the functions, classes and methods I will be using. 

OUTLINE

The first function of the program is going to be the input method for class creation.
This will need a visual component and a couple different things. 
I first want there to be a simple text box where the user inputs 7 items into the system. 
  -Each input will be a two digit number, with a range of 01-99. 
  -The seven inputs will be Character Level, and then each of the Six DnD stats. 
  -There will be text explaining to the user the valid input style as well as messages for improper inputs
After inputing the stats and level, the user then selects which proficiencies they have. They will be shown a list of all DnD skills, and there will be three buttons next to each one.
  -The buttons are proficient, expertiese, and normal. 

After inputing all this, the user will then be taken to the Dice Selection Screen

The Dice Selection screen will merely show all the different dice you can roll. For a majority of the dice, clicking on it will ask how many dice to roll, and if this is a damage roll. 
  =This would be for the D4, D6, D8, D10, and D12

Clicking on the D100 will simply roll the D100 and give an output

Clicking on the D20 is the most interesting. This will offer a variety of options in the form of different buttons and text boxes: shown below
    - Which Ability? (Text Box)
    - Which Skill? (Text Box)
    - Advantage / Disadvantage / Normal (Buttons)
    - Cursed / Bless / Guidence (Buttons)
After this, the dice will be rolled and the final total will be given to the user. There will also be specail messages for critical hits and misses.


CHARACTER CREATION
Input Level / Stats
    -These numbers will have to be saved and compared against an interal system
    -Level changes the characters proficiency mod
    -Raw Stat Number determines each Ability mod
    -Must be feedback when improper numbers are input
    -Planning to use GUI for visual components
    -Buttons for skills is a must, don't want the user having to type all that out
    -The proficiency bonus for each skill is taken from the hidden value of the user's level
    -Experts have doubled proficiency bonus
Dice Selector
    -If I can, reshape each button to look like the dice being selected
    -Each button opens up a secondary window for more selections (dice number/extra mod's)
    -Make is look nice, nobody wants a bland dice roller
Dice Roller
    -Use Numpy for random number generation
    -Do not forget to correctly do the math for the mod's and checks
    -Special messages when the random number is a 1 or 20 for d20 rolls
    -Advantage is running it twice and taking the greater number with disadvantage being the opposite
      -Compare the random numbers, take the higher/lower, THEN do the math
    -Cursed / bless / and guidence all add/subtract a d4 from the total of a roll
      -Do the roll and math, THEN random select a number 1-4 and add/subtract it from the other roll
